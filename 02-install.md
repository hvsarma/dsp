# Install software on your computer


### Install [git](http://git-scm.com/).

You have it installed if you can run `git --version` at the command
line and get output like `git version 2.3.5`.


### Install [Anaconda](http://continuum.io/downloads).

There are two things you can verify to check your install.

First, from the command line, all of the following should start up
some kind of Python interpreter:

```bash
python
ipython
ipython notebook
spyder
```

Second, inside any of those Python interpreters, you should be able to
do all of these without error:

```python
import numpy
import scipy
import matplotlib
import pandas
import statsmodels
import sklearn
```

Did you install Python 2 or 3? Why? How can you check the version of Python installed if you happen to be on an unfamiliar computer?

> I installed Python 2.7.x version from Anaconda distribution, for the primary reason that I do not have a good knowledge if ver3.0 backward compatible if I were to learn from someone else's code such as class exercises.

> On an unfamiliar computer, I would open commandline prompt (```cmd``` on Windows) and Terminal (on Mac), and type ```python``` to check the version or even to see if python is installed properly.

### Homebrew

If you use a Mac, install [Homebrew](http://brew.sh/) if you don't
have it yet. You could use Homebrew to manage your `git` and `python`
installs as well, but the methods given above are very good and more
cross-platform.
